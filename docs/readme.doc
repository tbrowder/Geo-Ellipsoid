Programs :  INVERSE, FORWARD, INVERS3D, FORWRD3D


Introduction :

The geodetic inverse, program INVERSE, is the tool for computing
the geodetic azimuth and distance between two points, given their
latitudes and longitudes.

The geodetic forward, program FORWARD, is the tool for computing
the latitude and longitude of a point, given the latitude and
longitude of a starting point and the geodetic azimuth and geodetic
distance between the points.

The three-dimensional versions of the geodetic inverse and
geodetic forward, programs INVERS3D and FORWRD3D, include the
ellipsoid height component.  Also included in the 3D programs are:

1) Conversions between geodetic positions (latitude, longitude,
and ellipsoid height) and rectangular coordinates (X,Y,Z in the
Conventional Terrestrial Reference System).

2) Conversions between the following four observation sets:
   a) DN,DE,DU (differential N, E, U using the FROM station 
      as the origin of the NEU-coordinate system.)
   b) DX,DY,DZ (differential X, Y, Z used to express GPS vectors)
   c) delta height, forward azimuth, ellipsoidal distance
   d) delta height, forward azimuth, mark-to-mark distance

Hardware Requirements :

Programs INVERSE, FORWARD, INVERS3D, and FORWRD3D are all written
in Fortran77 and complied on an IBM-PC or compatible.
  
       - A math-coprocessor is required,
       - 256 kb of RAM, and 
       - DOS version 2.1 or greater.

User Instructions :

All four programs run interactively; prompts are given for input,
and the output is directed to the screen.  Simply type the name
of the desired program, then answer the prompts as they appear. 
Once all the prompts have been answered, the output will appear
on the screen.  A prompt is given for saving the output into a
file, if desired.


Programs INVERSE and FORWARD allow the user to select from the
following list of reference ellipsoids for the computations:
  
     Clarke 1866    (NAD27)  
     GRS80 / WGS84  (NAD83)  
     Airy 1858 
     Airy Modified 
     Australian National 
     Bessel 1841 
     Clarke 1880 
     Everest 1830 
     Everest Modified 
     Fisher 1960 
     Fisher 1968 
     Hough 1956 
     International (Hayford) 
     Krassovsky 1938 
     NWL-9D (WGS 66) 
     South American 1969 
     Soviet Geod. System 1985 
     WGS 72 
     User defined.

Please note that the GRS80 and WGS84 are considered to be the
same.  Actually, there is a very small difference in the
flattening which results in the semi-minor axis, b, being
different by 0.0001 meters.  There is no known application for
which this difference is significant.

The user is given the option of defining their own reference
ellipsoid in whatever units they prefer.  (If, for example, the
user wishes to define the semi-major and semi-minor axes in
miles, they may do so.  The units for the geodetic distance would
then be given in miles also.)  The units for all the listed
reference ellipsoid are given in meters, and therefore the
distances are also in meters.

Programs INVERS3D and FORWRD3D work exclusively on the GRS80
ellipsoid and the units are meters.


Note 1 :

Program FORWRD3D will do a conversion from mark-to-mark distance
to ellipsoidal distance, if a mark-to-mark distance is given as
input.  The first approximation is computed using formulas given
in the NOAA Technical Memorandum NOS NGS-10, Use of Calibration
Baselines, pages 26-27.  These formulas are generally good for
distances less than 100 kilometers.  The program will then do a
forward computation using the computed ellipsoidal distance.  The
mark-to-mark distance is then recomputed from the resulting
DX,DY,DZ.  If the difference between the computed mark-to-mark
distance and the original mark-to-mark distance is greater than
one millimeter, then the difference is applied to the ellipsoidal
distance and another forward computation is performed.  The
program will continue iterating in this fashion until convergence.

Note 2 :

All four program read the input geodetic positions as real
numbers (latitudes are positive North, and longitudes are
positive East), then convert them to radians for internal
computations.  The conversion is done as follows:

radians = ( pi / 180 )* (degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/3600)



The programs return the input values after :
     1. Converting them into degrees, minutes, and seconds and 
     2. Checking d,m,s for the correct within range.  




Some example latitude inputs are :
    
     Hemisphere h = (blank,N,n,+   or  S,s,-)
     Commas or blanks may be used between the D,M,S entries.
