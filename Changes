Revision history for Perl module Geo::Ellipsoid

1.0 <date???>
    Perl 6 version released to the public: submitted to the Perl 6
    module ecosystem.  A translation from the CPAN Perl 5 version
    1.12.

# from the CPAN Perl 5 version:

1.12 Fri Jul 4 2008
    1. Correct bearing tests in 09-bearing.t

1.1 Sun Jun 30 2008
    1. Added set_longitude_symmetric, set_bearing_symmetric, and 
       set_distance_unit methods
    2. Corrected example of at method in documentation
    3. Ensured no test too close to range boundaries (0,360 or -180,180)
    4. Removed non-POD method headers as redundant.
    5. Added tests for different distance units and symmetrical output
       ranges.

1.0 Fri Mar 21 2008
    1. Normalized calculated angle result from _inverse to be
       less than 360.00 using _normalize_input subroutine.
    2. Fixed POD error (extraneous =over)
    3. Add 'use 5.006_00;' statement to abort Perls earlier than 5.6.0
       because of 'our' statements.
    4. Fix tests expecting 360 degrees for angles; change to 0.

0.904 Tue Aug 22 2006
    1. Eliminate tests using points too far away.
    2. Use delta_ok with relative test instead of delta_within for large
       ranges.

0.903 Sat Aug 19 2006
    1. Change test for zero flattening to use delta_within instead of delta_ok

0.902 Fri Nov 4 2005
    1. Change WGS84 flattening value to 298.257223563.
    2. Add set_defaults package method (and tests).
    3. Add 'IAU76' to POD section on DEFINED ELLIPSOIDS
    4. Croak on invalid ellipsoid or units.
    5. Don't change defaults except by set_defaults.
    6. Use package $DEBUG instead of instance $self->{debug} for debug.
    7. Don't test bearing angle between points when the same.

0.901 Mon Oct 31 2005
    1. Add Test::Number::Delta to prerequisites in Makefile.PL.
