TODO list for Perl module Geo::Ellipsoid

- Figure out what to do if _forward or _inverse does not converge
  because points are opposite each other

BEFORE RELEASE

- See if arg values should be constrained in some cases.

- Ensure all test suite scripts have a plan.

- Emulate or otherwise find some way to have an equivalent to the
  'delta_within' function.

- Make README.md instructions correct for the ecosystem.

- Ensure there is a test for bad invalid inputs for
  Geo::Ellipsoid.new, e.g., 'distance' instead of 'distance_units'.
